# The OG Learning Curve

# Observation, Action and Realization

This is how the actual learning curve works which we can break down in three stages:

### First Stage :

When we start working/learning anything new or build communications.  
It grows through observations and this is how we build initial understanding of such thing.  

### Second Stage :

Soon we have to start taking actions, because without practical actions the flow will dip down and weâ€™ll stop seeing results.  
taking consistent steps is necessity.  

### Third Stage :

The third stage is realization, this is what puts you ahead in the game, people who accept and realise key aspects of anything, play the game like a master.  

That was my learning and I firmly believe this analogy fits well with building relationships with people.
